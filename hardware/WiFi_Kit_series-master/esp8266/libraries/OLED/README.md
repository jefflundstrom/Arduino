This is an simple library for 128*32 I2C OLED displays on HelTec WIFI Kit 8.

## Credits

Original code was taken from [ESP8266-I2C-OLED](https://github.com/costonisp/ESP8266-I2C-OLED) project and was modified in form of a library suitable for using with [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software).

This library just include some basic initial and display function. We highly recommend use a u8g2 library.

## How to install u8g2 library

Search "u8g2" in Arduino library mananger and install it.
